Configuration for dnbd3-server

The server requires a config directory.
Start it like so: ./dnbd3-server -c ./my-config/

There are two files in that dir

== alt-servers ==
List of known alt-servers for this server.
Format:
[PREFIX]<IP:PORT> [Comment]

Prefix can be:
+ - Only report server to clients as alt-server, but don't use for replication
- - Only use server for replication, but don't advertise to clients
No prefix means server will be advertised to clients and is used for replication

If you're not running in proxy mode, this file won't do much for you

== server.conf ==

Main configuration file. Ini format.
